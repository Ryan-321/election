# Election

A app that allows you to create and keep track of voters as they sign up.  Voters are asked to give their name and address, which is then listed at the top of the voters list, along with when they registered.  

## Technologies Used

* Built in Rails
* Used Bootstrap to create a modal, which via AJAX will add a voter to the list
* If proper information is not provided in form, it will not let form be submitted and ask for form to be completed
